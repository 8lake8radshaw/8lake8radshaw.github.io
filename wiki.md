# MMP Voting System

The **Mixed Member Proportional** (MMP) voting system is a mixed electoral system where votes are cast for both individual candidates in local elections and for political parties, aiming to achieve a proportional representation in the legislature based on the party votes.

## Dual Voting
Under MMP, each voter gets two votes. The first vote is for a candidate to represent their local electoral area, much like in First Past the Post (FPTP) voting. The second vote is for a political party.

## Local Representatives
The local representatives are elected using the first vote, usually following a first-past-the-post system where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins.
## Party List Representation
The second vote is used to elect additional members from party lists to ensure that the overall composition of the legislature reflects the proportion of votes each party received.
## Proportional Representation 
The main goal of MMP is to achieve a proportional representation wherein the proportion of seats a political party has in the legislature is supposed to mirror the proportion of votes it received in the election.

## Allocation of Additional Seats
The party votes are tallied, and additional seats are allocated to parties to correct any disproportionality caused by the local elections. This is done by comparing the proportion of seats a party has won through the local elections to the proportion of the party vote it received. If a party has won fewer seats than its proportion of the party vote entitles it to, it is allotted additional seats from its party list until the proportionality is corrected​2​.

MMP is notably used in New Zealand, where it was introduced following a binding referendum in 1993 and first utilized in the 1996 election. Under New Zealand's MMP system, the parliament has 120 seats, and political parties compete to win as many of these seats as they can during an election​3​​4​.
